## Hi there, I'm Joseph ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year PhD candidate at Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and the [Inria MIND team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) (Paris-Saclay). 

:brain:	My work focuses on understanding individual treatment effects in neuroscience. I am interested in causal inference, statistical machine learning, and interpretable AI, with a particular emphasis on statistical inference for variable importance. My research also delves into brain functional imaging, especially EEG, and the application of deep learning techniques.
Before my PhD, I interned at Siemens Healthineers in Princeton, NJ, working on deep reinforcement learning approaches to assist in liver tumor surgeries.
